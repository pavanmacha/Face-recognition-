# Face-recognition-
OpenCV is a widely acclaimed open-source library that provides an extensive suite of computer vision and image processing functions. It offers a vast array of tools and techniques that empower developers to build cutting-edge applications in fields like robotics, augmented reality, facial recognition, object detection, and much more. With its powerful capabilities and user-friendly interface, OpenCV has become a go-to choice for developers worldwide

step 1  : Detection of face using Haascade algorithm taken and storedd in variable classifier 
step 2  : using Open cv live video cam with the help of classifier detected the face co ordinates
step 3  : cropping the face and visualizing with another window
step 4  : using np.zeros for all the coordinates of face filled with dark
step 5  : adding borders by drawing circles with the help of cv.circle() method
